"Now i want you create a logic to rank these locators and give them a score and add it to the json, assign static rule-based scores to each based on real-world best practices. Base Priority per Locator Type (0–1 scale) - get_by_role = 0.9,get_by_label = 0.85. get_by_text = 0.75, id = 0.7. css = 0.6, xpath = 0.4.
Scoring Criteria for Modifiers (± additive): aria-label present = +0.1,  Label/text has ≤ 5 words = +0.05, id looks machine-generated (abc123 or GUID)	= -0.2, class is generic (btn, main, etc.) = -0.15, innerText is too long (> 10 words) = -0.1, text/aria is all uppercase or non-alphabetic = -0.05, Element has no matching text at all = -0.3.Example Output - "locators": [ { "type": "get_by_role","locator": "page.get_by_role(\"button\", { name: \"Login\" })","score": 0.95 },{ "type": "get_by_label","locator": "page.get_by_label(\"Login\")","score": 0.9},{"type": "get_by_text","locator": "page.get_by_text(\"Login\")","score": 0.8 },{"type": "css","locator": "page.locator(\"button.btn\")","score": 0.6},{"type": "xpath","locator": "page.locator(\"//button[@type='submit']\")","score": 0.4}]. When the locator doesn't have the necceasry atributes skip the ranking system as we will be ignoring the locator in the final json output"
